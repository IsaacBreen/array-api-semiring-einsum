Semiring Einsum
===============

This is an implementation of einsum that supports multiple semirings. It is compatible wtih any library that conforms to the Python array API standard.

This is a reimplementation of [https://github.com/bdusell/semiring-einsum](Brian DuSell)'s library and is almost entirely his own work.
