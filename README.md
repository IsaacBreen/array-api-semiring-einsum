Semiring Einsum
===============

This is an implementation of einsum that supports multiple semirings. It is compatible wtih any library that conforms to the Python array API standard.

This is an adaptation of (https://github.com/bdusell/semiring-einsum)[Brian DuSell's] semiring einsum library for PyTorch - I simply replaced PyTorch with array API methods. If you found this useful, please direct 99.9% of your appreciation toward him.
